# Modular Design System

> Everything you need and nothing you don't.

The modular design system is meant to be used as needed to accomplish common design patterns. The System reflects my own philosophy and approach to designing for web, and is used to design & develop projects concurrently.

It includes a simple flexbox grid system, typographic structures, resets, configs, and interaction patterns like tabs, modals, dropdowns menus, and sliding drawers and panels.

The system is designed to be used within any given framework; it's agnostic css and js can be integrated with any build system and application framework. It's class-based design is meant to minimize compiled css while remaining extensible.
